# Basics

1. For security reasons, all requests need to be executed using HTTPS.
2. Requests with parameters such as "coin_from" or "coin_to" require a coin ticker in uppercase. Examples: "BTC," "ETH," "XMR."
3. "Extra ID" is an additional field for addresses of currencies that may use an additional ID for transaction processing, e.g.:
    - XRP (XRP) uses an ID named "Destination Tag."
    - Monero (XMR) uses an ID named "Payment ID."
    - Stellar (XML) uses an ID named "Memo."
4. This parameter should be filled only if the coin has this additional identifier. In any other case, this parameter is not filled out or sent.
5. The list of supported cryptocurrencies is constantly growing as we add new coins.
