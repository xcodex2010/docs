LetsExchange API ver.1 allows you to get programming access to the services the LetsExchange multi-currency exchange service.
Some of the requests have such parameters as 'coin_from' or ‘coin_to’, which a coin ticker in uppercase.
Examples: ‘BTC’, ‘ETH’, ‘XMR’, ‘IOTA’, ‘CLOAK’. This list is constantly growing as we’re adding new coins.
All requests need to be executed using HTTPS, this is a security measure.

Extra ID is an additional field for the wallet addresses of currencies that may use an additional ID for transaction
processing (XRP, STEEM/SBD, XLM, DCT, XEM, XMR). This parameter should be filled only if the coin has this additional identifier.
In any other case this parameter is not filled or not sent at all. All requests need to be executed using HTTPS,
this is a security measure.
