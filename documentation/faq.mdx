<Accordion title="Is it possible that coin is available only for a certain direction ?">
    All our coins are available for both buy and sell directions equally.
    Each coin from [v1/coins](/api-reference/endpoint/v1/coins/coins) or [v2/coins](/api-reference/endpoint/v2/coins/coins) response has `is_active` property.
    <Note>`is_active: 1` - means it’s fully available. `is_active: 0` - not available.</Note>

<Accordion title="I have generated 5 links via personal cabinet. How can I set the custom fee for each of them ?">

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there different affiliate IDs for each referral link ?">
    Each referral link or widget is associated with a distinct affiliate_id, which is unique to that specific link or widget.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens after the exchange gets an overdue status ?">
    An exchange becomes `overdue` after **30 minutes** have passed since the exchange was created. However, for API partners, we have expanded the actual waiting time for a deposit. Therefore, even after the exchange has received the `overdue` status, there are still **1.5 hours** during which we expect the deposit.

    <Note>We cannot wait longer as we try to guarantee the rate range even for FLOAT swaps. But there is no reason to worry about the deposit: even if we receive the deposit later, we still won’t lose it. It’s just that the exchange will not be started automatically, and we will wait for your request to start the exchange and agree on the updated rate.</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is it possible for you to provide smart contracts of evm tokens ?">
    Presently, we deliver all contract addresses for the list of coins via our API.

</Accordion>
