Below is the general exchange flow when using the LetsExchange API. The API Reference provides a detailed description of each request.


<Steps>
    <Step title="Get Coins List">
        To calculate the rate and subsequently create an exchange, you need to make a pair of cryptocurrencies that will be exchanged.
        You need to call the **[GET /api/v2/coins](/api-reference/endpoint/v2/coins/coins)** to get a list of coins to do this.
        By selecting two cryptocurrencies from the list, you will form a pair.
        <Note>Pay attention on `is_active` property.</Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Choose pair">
        Choose two coins with `is_active: 1` in coin and network as a pair for rate calculation
    </Step>
    <Step title="Rate Calculation">
        If you want to know the pair's rate in advance, use the **[POST /api/v1/info](/api-reference/endpoint/v1/coins/info)** request.
        You can also create an exchange without first calculating the exchange rate. This feature is available for the floating (market) rate only.
        For a fixed rate, you must first calculate the pair's rate and send the rate id.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Transaction">
        If you accept the rate calculated in step 3, you can create an exchange.
        Call API â€“ Create transaction with **[POST /api/v1/transaction](/api-reference/endpoint/v1/transaction/create-transaction)**
    </Step>
    <Step title="Check Transaction Status">
        The exchange processing involves changing statuses.
        To track the status of your transaction, use  **[GET /api/v1/transaction/\{id\}](/api-reference/endpoint/v1/transaction/get-transaction)**
    </Step>
