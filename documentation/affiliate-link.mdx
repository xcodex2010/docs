Affiliate link is a unique string through which the partner earns profit (the accrued profit can be checked in the personal
account) by passing this parameter string (affiliate_id) when creating an exchange. This parameter needs to be passed
with each rate calculation request and exchange creation. Multiple affiliate_ids can be used to understand the source
of user traffic.

To create an affiliate link, you need to [log in to your account on our website](https://my.letsexchange.io/auth/login)
and go to the **Affiliate Program** section.

After that, you will have the option to create an **Affiliate link** or **Widget and button**.
Once you create an **Affiliate link**, you will see it added to your list, and by clicking on it,
you will see its **ID**. It will be displayed as `ref_id=tKxRGxxxx78xloBL`.

<Warning>`tKxRGxxxx78xloBL` - will be your affiliate ID that you need to include in the rate calculation and exchange creation requests.</Warning>

If you do not want to implement your own widget from scratch and deal with the specifics of working with the API,
you can generate a custom **Widget** or **Button** and place it on your website by adding a small script that
will be displayed to you. Users will create exchanges, and you will earn profit from this.
