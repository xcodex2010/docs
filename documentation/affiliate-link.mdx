LetsExchange partners who have integrated API receive income from every exchange their users make.

The basic revenue share is **0.2%** of the exchange amount. However, partners can set a different revenue share based on their business goals.

To record the user's exchange and income for the partner, the **affiliate_id** (ref_id) parameter must be sent with each request for calculating the rate and creating an exchange.

When using multiple sources of user traffic, you can create multiple **affiliate_ids** for each of them.

All information on all exchanges and the amount of income is available in the personal account on LetsExchange.

To **create an affiliate_id**, you need to [log into your account](https://my.letsexchange.io/auth/login) and go to the **Affiliate Program** section.

Next, in the "Referral Links" menu you need to create a new link. Once you create an affiliate link, you will see it added to your list. By clicking on it, you will see its ID. It will be displayed as `ref_id=tKxRGxxxx78xloBL`.

<Warning>`tKxRGxxxx78xloBL` will be the **affiliate ID** that you need to include in the rate calculation and exchange creation requests.</Warning>
