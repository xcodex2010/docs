LetsExchange partners who integrate the API receive income from every exchange their users make.

The basic revenue share is **0.2%** of the exchange amount. However, partners can set a different revenue share depending on their business goals.

To record a user’s exchange and calculate income for the partner, the **affiliate_id** parameter (also referred to as ref_id) must be included in API requests for **rate calculation** and **exchange creation**.

If you work with multiple traffic sources, you can create multiple **affiliate_ids** – one for each source.

All statistics on exchanges and income are available in your **personal account** on LetsExchange.

# Using affiliate_id in the API

Each API request must include:

- your **affiliate_id**
- your **API key**

The **affiliate_id** identifies your transactions in our system so we can track your referrals and calculate your earnings.

The **API key** is required to authenticate your requests and verify your identity.

# How to create an affiliate_id

1. Log in to your LetsExchange account.
2. Go to the **Affiliate Program** section.
3. In the **Referral links** menu, click **Create link**.
4. After creating the link, it will appear in your list.
5. Click on the link to view its ID – it will be displayed as:
 **ref_id=tKxRGxxxx78xloBL**. Need more information? – Visit this page.

**tKxRGxxxx78xloBL** will be the **affiliate_id** you must include in the rate calculation and exchange creation requests.

# How to create an API key

1. Go to [letsexchange.io](https://my.letsexchange.io/auth/login) → **Account** → **API for developers** section.
2. Click **Create new API key** to generate your key.
3. Use this key in all API requests.
