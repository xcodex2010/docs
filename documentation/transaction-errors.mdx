<Accordion title="50001 - Missed memo">
    The user did not include a Memo when sending the deposit, which resulted in a delay in processing the exchange.
    In such cases, the exchange process cannot be completed automatically and requires manual intervention to resolve the issue.
    Please stay in touch with the LetsExchange support team.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="50002 - Clarification needed">
    We received the deposit after a long delay. In such cases, we need additional verification.
    Please confirm with the user that the current exchange rate may be used for the transaction. Funds can also be refunded.
