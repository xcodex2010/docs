With the LetsExchange DeFi API, you can easily add decentralized cross-chain swaps to your app.
The API works with multiple blockchain networks. All swaps happen directly in the user's wallet.

Using this mode, youâ€™ll receive the same partner commission (in BTC) as you do for centralized
exchanges. If you need a custom fee for DeFi swaps, please contact your B2B manager.

Below is the exchange flow when using the LetsExchange DeFi API.

To perform a DeFi exchange, you need to follow these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Call **[GET /api/v1/dex/networks](/api-reference/endpoint/v1/transaction/dex/networks)** to get a list of available blockchain networks.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Call **[GET /api/v1/dex/coins](/api-reference/endpoint/v1/transaction/dex/coins)** to get a recommended list
        of coins or use your own list. You can exchange any token by its contract address, even if it is not in our coin list.
    </Step>
    <Step>
         Call **[POST /api/v1/dex/quote](/api-reference/endpoint/v1/transaction/dex/quote)** to get a quote rate.
    </Step>
    <Step>
         Call **[POST /api/v1/dex/transaction](/api-reference/endpoint/v1/transaction/dex/swap)** to create an
         exchange for receiving swap/approve payload data and an exchange identifier.
    </Step>
    <Step>
         If the source token isn't the native one used to pay network fees (like ETH on Ethereum),
         a user must permit its spending. To do that, he must sign the **approve** transaction from the previous
         step and send it to the approval address provided. This lets the system know it can use tokens for the swap.
    </Step>
    <Step>
         Sign the swap payload data obtained in step 4 using a wallet private key and send it
         to the swap address in the source blockchain network.
    </Step>
    <Step>
         Call **[GET /api/v1/dex/transaction/{id}](/api-reference/endpoint/v1/transaction/dex/get-swap-info)** to get
         information about the progress of the exchange.
    </Step>
</Steps>
