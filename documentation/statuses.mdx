LetsExchange processes 98% of all transactions automatically. Depending on the selected cryptocurrencies, the average transaction time ranges from 5 to 40 minutes.


We recommend notifying users about the expected time of the exchange and showing them statuses to demonstrate that an exchange process is ongoing.


It is also advisable to inform users that if an exchange lasts longer than the specified period or there is an error, they can contact support.

LetsExchange uses the services of leading AML providers for automatic AML verification. These providers assess risks according to a generally accepted risk table.
In the response about an error due to high AML risks, we pass a list of signals and the percentage for each signal – "aml_error_signals."
You must decide whether to display this information to the user.

### <Icon icon="bookmark" iconType="regular" color="#ea5e5e" size={20} /> overdue
> The deposit receiving time for this transaction has expired.
<Note>The time to send a deposit is limited to **30 minutes**. This is necessary to avoid unacceptable exchange rate fluctuations due to market volatility.</Note>


### <Icon icon="bookmark" iconType="regular" color="#ea5e5e" size={20} /> error
> The transaction failed. The reason for the error may vary. However, in most cases, the amount sent differs from the amount specified when creating the transaction.
In case of an error, you can contact the [LetsExchange support service](https://letsexchange.io/contact), which is **available 24/7**.
To get a response asap, we need information about the Exchange ID, the response you received via the API, and the request to which the response was received.


### <Icon icon="bookmark" iconType="regular" color="#ea5e5e" size={20} /> refund
> The transaction failed. The funds were returned to the user's address, which he sent them from.
<Note>Please note that funds are not refunded automatically. Contacting the LetsExchange support is mandatory.</Note>
