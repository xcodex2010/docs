LetsExchange **API ver. 1** displays a list of cryptocurrencies in the form of coin codes and networks.

LetsExchange **API ver. 2** displays an aggregated list of cryptocurrencies containing a list of networks for each specific coin.
<Info>We recommend using **API ver.2**.</Info>

<Warning>
Note:
- Some requests have parameters such as coin_from or coin_to, which represent the coin ticket in uppercase. Examples: BTC, ETH, XMR. This list is constantly growing as new coins are added.
- All requests must be made using HTTPS as a security measure.
- "Extra ID" is an additional field for addresses of currencies that may use an additional ID for transaction processing, e.g.:
    - XRP (XRP) uses an ID named "Destination Tag."
    - Monero (XMR) uses an ID named "Payment ID."
    - Stellar (XML) uses an ID named "Memo."
- This parameter should be filled only if the coin has this additional identifier. In any other case, this parameter is not filled out or sent.
</Warning>

<Note>
    For **each request**, the following parameters must be used in the headers:
    ```json
    {
        'headers': {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Accept': 'application/json'
        }
    }
    ```
