Before calling the API, the account's API key needs to be generated to verify the partner's identity.
[You can log in on the website](https://my.letsexchange.io/auth/login) and generate it by going to the **API for developers** section.
Learn more [here](https://letsexchange.io/blog/how-to-manage-api-keys/) if you need more information.

Each account can have **5 API keys**. Each key's permission configuration is independent of the others. We recommend giving each key a name to indicate its purpose.

You can also add an **IP whitelist**, which allows the server to accept requests only from specified IPs. If the IP whitelist is not set, the server will skip client IP validation.

<Note>
To use the API key, each of your requests must contain an [Authorization header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization):

```json
{
    'headers': {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer %API_KEY_STRING%'
    }
}
```
</Note>

{/* <Warning> */}
{/* Each API Key is limited by the number of requests: **400 requests in 1 minutes**. */}
{/* </Warning> */}

<Warning>
If you received a response with [HTTP status code 403](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403), you have set an **incorrect API key** for the bearer token authorization.
</Warning>
