Before calling the private API, the API key of the account needs to be generated to verify the identity. [You can log in on the website and generate it in](https://letsexchange.io/dashboard/api-keys).

Each account can create **5 API keys**, and the permission configuration of each key is independent of each other. It is recommended to set a note name for each key to indicate its purpose.

Besides, you can attach an **IP whitelist**, which requires the server only accept requests from specified IPs. If IP whitelist is not set, the server will skip client IP validation.


<Note>
To use the API key, each of your requests must contain an [Authorization header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization):

```json
{
    'headers': {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer %API_KEY%'
    }
}
```
</Note>


<Warning>
Each API Key is limited by the number of requests per hour, 400 requests in 1 hour.
